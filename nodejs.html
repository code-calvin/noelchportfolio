									<h1>How I built a<br />
									Discord Bot</h1>
									<p>What is a Discord Bot? A discord bot is a bot user designed to automate tasks. <br>
									This bot can do anything a user can do. It uses code, in this case javascript, <br>
									which the developer can use to calculate anything not discord related, or discord related
								</p>

								<p>
                                    I built a Ticket Bot, which can create, and delete channels. To start off, I defined
                                    the guild, parent category, and then created a channel under that category. The goals
                                    for this project were: <br>
									1. Get input from the user (reactions) <br>
									2. Create a channel under the category Tickets <br>
									3. Send a message in the channel, when it is created <br>
									4. Be able to delete the ticket (channel) with a reaction <br>
									5. Make it so it can not crash (infinite lifetime program) <br>
								</p>

								<p>
									With that in mind, I could break this problem even further. To take the input I could
                                    use the discord.js event called <i>"messageReactionAdd"</i>. This would allow the bot
                                    to run code after a reaction. If they reacted to the correct emoji, in the correct channel,
                                    it created a channel under the <i>Tickets</i> category.
								</p>
								
								<p>
                                    Once the channel had been created, the bot sent a message notifying all staff about the ticket.
                                    This part was crucial as the staff might not notice, and a ticket means support ticket. Then, the
                                    staff could talk to the user. Once the issue was resolved, the could react to an emoji which the
                                    bot reacted to on their first message. This deletes the channel, and closes the ticket. We do not
                                    want to delete a random channel, so I used a javascript Map() to determine whether the channel was
                                    a ticket or not. When the channel was created, it would be added. When the person reacted, it checks
                                    if the channel was a <i>Ticket</i>. If so, the channel could be deleted. If not, the reaction command
                                    would not continue.
